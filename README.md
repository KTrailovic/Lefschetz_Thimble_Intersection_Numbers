## Overview
 
The Mathematica notebook **`MultipleShootingMethod.nb`** demonstrates the numerical procedure proposed in the paper for evaluating the intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles.
 
The code includes:
- Implementation of the multiple shooting algorithm to solve the upward flow equation.
- Computation of the sign of the intersection number.
- Example with three variable Airy-type integral vizualizing the upward flow.
 
This notebook serves as a reproducible illustration of the algorithm.

## Requirements
 
- **Mathematica 13.0** or later (earlier versions may work but are untested)
